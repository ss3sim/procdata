Code to investigate interaction of process error and data weighting 

This repository was used to run the simulation found in:

Ian J. Stewart, Cole C. Monnahan, Implications of process error in selectivity for approaches to weighting compositional data in fisheries stock assessments, Fisheries Research, Available online 25 July 2016, ISSN 0165-7836, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2016.06.018.
(http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783616302077)

To reproduce this simulation, download or clone this repo and source the file run_simulation.R. You may need to install some R packages found in startup.R.
